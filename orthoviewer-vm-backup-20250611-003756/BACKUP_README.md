# 🛡️ OrthoViewer VM Backup - Rocky@10.0.0.213

## 📊 **Backup Information**
- **Backup Date**: June 11, 2025 - 00:37:56 UTC
- **Source Server**: rocky@10.0.0.213
- **Source Path**: `/home/rocky/orthoviewer/`
- **Backup Location**: `~/Documents/OrthoViewer-backups/orthoviewer-vm-backup-20250611-003756/`
- **Backup Method**: `scp -r` (secure copy recursive)

## 🎯 **Purpose of This Backup**
This backup was created **BEFORE** deploying the optimized `feat/GNP-6697-rocky-deployment` branch to preserve any work-in-progress on the VM that might be lost during deployment.

## 📋 **VM State at Backup Time**

### **Git Status**
- **Branch**: `docker-infrastructure-complete`
- **Last Commit**: `270a1eb1` - "Fix: orthologues display in Export, improve biological research context"
- **Working Directory**: **100+ modified files** (uncommitted changes)
- **Status**: Many files were modified but not committed - potentially important work in progress

### **Key Findings**
1. **VM was on older branch** (`docker-infrastructure-complete`) vs our local optimized branch
2. **Lots of uncommitted changes** - could be valuable development work
3. **Different commit history** - VM was behind our local optimizations

## 📁 **What's Included in This Backup**
- ✅ Complete `.git` repository with all history
- ✅ All source code (backend, frontend-vite, scripts, etc.)
- ✅ Configuration files (docker-compose, nginx, etc.)
- ✅ Data files (`data/orthofinder/` directory)
- ✅ All uncommitted changes that were on the VM
- ✅ Build artifacts and logs

## 🚀 **Next Steps After Backup**
1. **Safe to deploy** - All VM work is now preserved
2. **Deploy optimized branch** - `feat/GNP-6697-rocky-deployment` can be safely deployed
3. **Compare changes** - Can later diff this backup against optimized version if needed
4. **Restore if needed** - This backup can be used to restore VM state if something goes wrong

## 🔍 **Important Files Backed Up**
- **Backend**: Complete FastAPI application with all services
- **Frontend**: React/Vite application with all components
- **Docker**: All containerization configs (`docker-compose.yml`, Dockerfiles)
- **Scripts**: All deployment and development scripts
- **Data**: OrthoFinder data and species mappings
- **Tests**: Complete test suite and performance benchmarks

## ⚠️ **Notes**
- This backup contains **uncommitted changes** that were not in any git branch
- The VM was running branch `docker-infrastructure-complete` (older than our optimized version)
- Some files might be environment-specific to the Rocky VM
- Large files included: `data/orthofinder/Orthogroups_clean_121124.txt` (53MB)

## 🔄 **How to Use This Backup**
If needed, this entire directory can be copied back to any server:
```bash
# To restore to VM (if needed)
scp -r ./orthoviewer-vm-backup-20250611-003756/* rocky@10.0.0.213:/home/rocky/orthoviewer/

# To compare with current version
diff -r ./orthoviewer-vm-backup-20250611-003756/ /path/to/current/orthoviewer/
```
